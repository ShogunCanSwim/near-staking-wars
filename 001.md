# Stake Wars: Episode III. Challenge 001

Create your Shardnet wallet & deploy the NEAR CLI. This is designed to be your very first challenge: use it to understand how staking on NEAR works.

## Deliverables

1. Create a wallet on ShardNet
2. Setup Near CLI
3. CLI commands

## 1. Create a wallet on ShardNet

Follow instructions onÂ [https://wallet.shardnet.near.org/](https://wallet.shardnet.near.org/)

Now 1 wallet has 500 NEAR at first, if seat price now higher than 500 NEAR, you should create more than 1 wallet and send NEAR to main wallet. Refer seat price here: [https://explorer.shardnet.near.org/nodes/validators](https://explorer.shardnet.near.org/nodes/validators)

## 2. Setup Near CLI

Access to server via SSH and do the below commands. If you intend to use GCP to run your node, please refer Challenge 005 first.
```
# Update apt
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Node.js and npm
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -  
sudo apt install build-essential nodejs -y
PATH="$PATH"

# Check version
node -v
v18.6.0

npm -v
8.13.2

# Install near-cli
sudo npm install -g near-cli

# For this chunk-only producer, we'll be using shardnet
echo 'export NEAR_ENV=shardnet' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

## 3. CLI commands

*Proposals*

A proposal by a validator indicates they would like to enter the validator set, in order for a proposal to be accepted it must meet the minimum seat price.

Command: `near proposals`

*Validators Current*

This shows a list of active validators in the current epoch, the number of blocks produced, number of blocks expected, and online rate. Used to monitor if a validator is having issues.

Command: `near validators current`

*Validators Next*

This shows validators whose proposal was accepted one epoch ago, and that will enter the validator set in the next epoch.

Command: `near validators next`
